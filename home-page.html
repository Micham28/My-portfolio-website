			<p>Thing I Know and Like</p>
			<p class="topic">
				C#, one of my prefered programing languages. Could also be due to the professor I had and his<br> skills but how information was moved stored and printed just seemed to make more sense.
			</p>
			<p class="topic">
				HTML/CSS, this is by far my favorite form of programing language, I say this in part to the fact <br>that while I am programing I get to see the interactions of my knowledge and code <br> coming to life as I update.
			</p>
			<p class="topic">
				Cisco OS, was in my opinion very straight forword, it was plain english and was all console <br>interaction. The other thing that made it one of my favorite tools is that the <br>math wasn't overly complex, just breaking components of IPv4 addresses.
			</p>
			<p class="topic">
				SQL, I just like this one as it makes reading and interpeting the information programs store<br> easy to access.
			</p>
			<p class="topic">
				Large Challenging Projects, challenging myself has always been something I enjoyed learning where <br>I am at and where I have yet to get to has always interested me. I have also always loved <br> working on a team the support you can give one another lends a helping hand when I pile <br>too much of a challenge on my plate. 
			</p>
			<p class="topic">
				***Since this is only a welcoming page I will provide a brief directory here.***
				<ol>
					<li class="listi">CVFile - Contains a condensed view of all the information here as well as easier navigated links and contact.</li>
					<li class="listi">All - Tab/Navigation bar links for to expand and amplify the experience of the information in my CVFile.</li>
					<li class="listi">Icons - Pages will occasionally have icons, these icons are fully interactable, so click and see.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="listi">***Please keep in mind you may see this site change from time to time, this is due in part to me building my portfolio website in my free time so not all components will look as done as others.***</p>
